# UnionizeGithub
If Github employees stand with Black Lives Matter they will Unionize and demand the ICE contract is terminated.

Github is giving all this lipservice to the Black Lives Matter movement while working directly with a group that terrorizes the Black and Brown communities. Many employees at Github have voiced their concerns with this contract but it obviously fell on deaf ears. Github and Microsoft have proven they will not listen to their employees which leaves them the only option. To unionize and demand the ICE contract is terminated as part of the Union.

Black Lives Matter is not just three words. It is not an oppurtunity for y'all to pretend to stand with us. It is an oppurtunity to enact true change even in that face of adversity and PROVE y'all care about us. Please, do what's right. Unionize.

BLACK LIVES MATTER
